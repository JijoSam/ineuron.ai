Strings can begin and end with double quotes, just as they do with single quotes. 
One benefit of using double quotes is that the string can have a single quote character in it. 
Since the string begins with a double quote, 
Python knows that the single quote is part of the string and not marking the end of the string. 
   
    However, if you need to use both single quotes and double quotes in the string, 
    youâ€™ll need to use escape characters.,
    Python knows that since the single quote in Howl\'s has a backslash, 
    it is not a single quote meant to end the string value.
    The escape characters \' and \" let you put single quotes and double quotes inside your strings, respectively.
